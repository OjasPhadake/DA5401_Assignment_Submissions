## 📝 Problem Statement
This assignment aims to deepen the understanding of the challenges in real-world machine learning, specifically in **multi-label classification**, by utilizing advanced **non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques** such as **t-SNE and Isomap**. Visually inspect the data for issues such as noisy labels, outliers, and hard-to-learn data points, sparking curiosity about data veracity in a biological context.

The goal of this assignment is to apply t-SNE and Isomap to the feature vectors to visually expose these data quality issues, thereby understanding the challenges a classifier would face.
